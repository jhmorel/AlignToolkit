### About the Addon

This addon was designed for my personal convenience, primarily to streamline processes when modeling environments. It may contain bugs, and I would greatly appreciate if you could report them as we are actively working on fixing them and adding new features as they arise.

This is a free-to-use tool, and I hope it proves useful. If you'd like to support me as a 3D artist, you can do so on Ko-fi: [ko-fi.com/jhmorel](https://ko-fi.com/jhmorel).
